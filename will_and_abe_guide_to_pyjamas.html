So what's pyjamas?
    It's a widget set.
What's a widget set?
    it's where you can do stuff.
What kind of stuff?
    well, make things look pretty.
Why?
    because you can see them better.
See what?
    the stuff.
How do you do that?
    in python.
I like snakes.
    python isn't a snake
Yes it is
    no it isn't
Yes it is
    no it isn't
Is
    Isn't
...
    ...


Why would you use a snake?
    it's python
ok why would you use python?
    because it's easy.
What is?
    doing HTML widgets in pyjamas.
What's pyjamas?
    It's a compiler.
but you said it's a widget set!
    yes.  it's a compiler, too.
make up your mind!
    no.  it's *my* project. nyer.
You're childish!
    yes.  i'm four.
ok.  what's HTML?
    it's this easy-peasy web stuff.
is that like widget stuff?
    yes, only easier.
I read up on HTML.  it sucks.
    no it doesn't.
Yes it does.
    no it doesn't.
Yes it does.
    doesn't
does
    doesn't
...
    ...


So why is it easier?
    because you don't need javascript.
But you said python.
    yes.  that's the compiler bit.
the what?
    the compiler turns python into javascript.
But you said it's in python?
    yes but... look...
How come you can run python on the web?
    you can't, it's javascript
But you said it's python.  How??
    look, I said already: it's compiled to javascript.
I read up on javascript.  it sucks.
    yes it does.
It's as slow as a sick dog.
    yes.  that's why there's Pyjamas-Desktop.
What's pyjamas-desktop?
    it's pyjamas, only without the javascript.
Huh?
    and you can run it in a web engine.
But you said you needed javascript!
    not with a web engine you don't.
But if you need javascript, how can you run?
    with python
But web engines don't have python on them!
    yes they do
No they don't
    yes they do
No they don't
    do
don't
    do
...
    ...


Ok, so how, then?
    wiv COM an' XPCOM an' Glib/Gobject
huh?
    it's magic
ohhhhhh.  maagiiiic.
    voodoooo.
voodoo atchoo to you too
    thank you!
hahaaha
    hahaha
So how does this magic work then?
    it manipulates DOM
What's DOM?
    It's done by the W3C
Who are they?
    they're people with too much time on their hands.
Ah.  do they get anything done?
    yes - lots.
Such as?
    writing DOM
What's DOM?
    it's this way to access HTML n stuff.
But HTML sucks!
    yes it does when you haven't got voodoo
Atchoo!
    bless you.
Thank you.  So, python voodoo makes pyjamas magic?
    yes.
How?
    same as javascript does.
But you said there was no javascript!
    yes.
.@?#??
    I voodoo'd you!
hahaha
    hahaha - wooo!


Ok, so why am I doing python pyjamas voodoo?
    because it's easy.
HTML sucks!
    forget HTML
But you said pyjamas uses HTML!
    it does, as DOM, only...
How can pyjamas be any good if it does HTML??
    because... look...
I don't wanna play with pyjamas if it uses HTML
    it doesn't - not really
But you said it does!
    look, I'm only four, ok?
Can we play with snakes, instead?
    yes. how about python?
Can we paint them to look like they're in pyjamas?
    yeah!
Yaay!


I heard you have to run HTML in a browser.
    yes.
Do you run pyjamas in a browser, too?
    only if you compile it to javascript.
But you said there was no javascript?
    that's the desktop version.
Er... how does that work, again?
    voodoo.
Ah.  Not running on python a server, then?
    no.
So if it's not python in a browser, and it's not python on a server...
    that's why it's voodoo.
Ahhhh.


Is pyjamas better than Qt4 and GTK2, then?
    yes.
Why?
    because they suck.
No they don't!
    yes they do
don't
    do
don't
    ...
...

Why do Qt4 and GTK2 suck, then?
    they don't - not really
But you said they do!
    they're good at what they do.
But not as good as pyjamas voodoo?
    woo-woo!
hahahaa
    hahaaa

So, really.
    yes?
Why is pyjamas better?
    because of DOM
But DOM is HTML
    yes, but...
And HTML sucks
    yes, but...
So why is pyjamas, which is voodoo DOM without the javascript, and...
    you don't _have_ to do HTML, you can just do DOM
But you end up producing HTML?
    yes.
How?
    only if you get the innerHTML of a bit of DOM
Huh?
    it's in the W3C
But they're rocket scientists with too much time on their hands!
    yes, but veery clever ones.
Ohhhhh... W3C voodooo
    atchoo!
Bless you
