 * doAttachChildren(self)

 * doDetachChildren(self)

 * getID(self)
{{-method
Get the id attribute of the associated DOM element.
}}

 * getLayoutData(self)

 * getParent(self)
{{-method
Widgets are kept in a hierarchy, and widgets that have been added to a panel
will have a parent widget that contains them.  This retrieves the containing
widget for this widget.
}}

 * isAttached(self)
{{-method
Return whether or not this widget has been attached to the document.
}}

 * onAttach(self)
{{-method
Called when this widget has an element, and that element is on the document's
DOM tree, and we have a parent widget.
}}

 * onDetach(self)
{{-method
Called when this widget is being removed from the DOM tree of the document.
}}

 * onLoad(self, sender)

 * removeFromParent(self)
{{-method
Remove ourself from our parent.  The parent widget will call setParent(None) on
us automatically
}}

 * setID(self, id)
{{-method
Set the id attribute of the associated DOM element.
}}

 * setLayoutData(self, layoutData)

 * setParent(self, parent)
{{-method
Update the parent attribute.  If the parent is currently attached to the DOM this
assumes we are being attached also and calls onAttach().
}}



== Methods inherited from UIObject: ==

 * addStyleName(self, style)
{{-method
Append a style to the element associated with this UIObject.  This is
a CSS class name.  It will be added after any already-assigned CSS class for
the element.
}}

 * getAbsoluteLeft(self)

 * getAbsoluteTop(self)

 * getElement(self)
{{-method
Get the DOM element associated with the UIObject, if any
}}

 * getOffsetHeight(self)

 * getOffsetWidth(self)

 * getStyleName(self)

 * getTitle(self)

 * isVisible(self, element=None)
{{-method
Determine whether this element is currently visible, by checking the CSS

Remove a style from the element associated with this UIObject.  This is
a CSS class name.
}}

 * setElement(self, element)
{{-method
Set the DOM element associated with the UIObject.

 * setHeight(self, height)
{{-method
Set the height of the element associated with this UIObject.  The

}}

 * setPixelSize(self, width, height)
{{-method
Set the width and height of the element associated with this UIObject
in pixels.  Width and height should be numbers.
}}

 * setSize(self, width, height)
{{-method
Set the width and height of the element associated with this UIObject.  The
values should be given as a CSS value, such as 100px, 30%, or 50pi

 * setStyleName(self, element, style=None, add=True)
{{-method
