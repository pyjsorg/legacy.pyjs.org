Pyjamas has been hosted on various locations in its lifetime. The current official one is <a href="http://pyjs.org/">pyjs.org</a>, but
some others are (somehow) still alive as of 2012:
</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyjamas/">Google Code</a> is now only used as an issue tracker.</li>
   <li><a href="http://pyjamas.git.sourceforge.net/git/gitweb.cgi?p=pyjamas/pyjamas">Sourceforge</a> was the previous git repository (now cleared).</li>

</ul>
