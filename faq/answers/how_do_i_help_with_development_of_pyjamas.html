For best practices, you should read the DEVELOPER.RULES file which comes
with the standard pyjamas distribution.  The web site is itself a pyjamas
application, so the DEVELOPER.RULES even apply to contributions to the
web site.

If you just want to submit a single modification, submit it as a
patch, in diff format, at the
<a href="https://github.com/pyjs/pyjs/issues/">pyjamas bugtracker</a>
and then it is best to join the mailing list, pyjamas-dev, and let people
know.  You should ideally use git diff or git-am.  <tt>(Note: if you are a
Windows user, go and get git-win32: there is no excuse for not using the best
tools for the job!)</tt>
</p>
<p>
However, if you want to regularly submit patches, just ask on pyjamas-dev
and you will be given an account, simple as that.  You will be expected to
follow, at all times, the DEVELOPER.RULES, which are really quite
straightforward and are there to give you the freedom to do whatever
you like, as long as it doesn't inconvenience anyone else (users
or developers).
