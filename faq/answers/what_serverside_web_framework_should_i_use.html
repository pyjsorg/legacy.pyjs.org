Absolutely anything you like.  Literally anything.  CGI-Scripts,
ASP/.NET, PHP, Apache, WSGI - you name it, you can use it.  The
reason is simple: the Pyjamas python code gets compiled to some
HTML and some Javascript - that's it.  So, just like <i>any</i>
web pages, you simply need something that will load ... web pages.
duh.
