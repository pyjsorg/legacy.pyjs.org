This is a highly subjective question, but if you are new to web development,
you will be asking these kinds of questions.  Given that you're considering
python, logically it makes sense to pick a python-based web framework.
If you're going to do AJAX, you should really use JSONRPC.  If you're
using JSONRPC, you should pick a framework that is known to have mature
JSONRPC server-side support, and that means
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com">Django</a>,
<a href="http://web2py.com">Web2Py</a>,
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a>, and many more.  See the
<a href="https://github.com/pyjs/pyjs/wiki/">Pyjamas Wiki</a>
for links to various JSONRPC integration HOWTOs.

That having been said: if you're starting entirely from scratch,
Django has to come out overall on top, even though you will not be
using all of its features.  The SQL ORM in Django is excellent;
the tutorials to get started are excellent; the developers and users
on the (busy) IRC channel are very helpful and responsive.
