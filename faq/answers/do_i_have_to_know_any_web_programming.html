It helps if you know a little bit about how CSS works, because
the Pyjamas User-Interface widgets, like all Widget Sets, are designed
around "function" and "purpose", not "form" or "look".  It would also help
if you had a basic grasp of a tiny bit of HTML, such as what &lt;b&gt; etc.
does.  For everything else, such as tables, there are Widgets such as Grid
that are much more practical to use.
