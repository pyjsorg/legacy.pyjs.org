Pyjamas Web development actually has more in common with Python-Qt4
and Python-GTK2 than it does with "traditional" web development.
The base widgets (of which there are over 50) have almost exact
corresponding analogues in Desktop Widget sets.  The nice thing about
Pyjamas, though, when compared to the Desktop Widget frameworks is that you
get "true" HTML / CSS interoperability, and "true" plugin support such as
Adobe Flash, all for free.
