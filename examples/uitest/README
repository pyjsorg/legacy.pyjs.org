ok i've created the beginnings of a uitest.

* run with pyjd to 'create' the tests (once):
   python uitest.py public

* do a git diff to make sure that test output already committed
  hasn't changed (unless it was a bug!)

* do git add public/*.txt

* commit

to run the test to confirm, just do python uitest.py, or build them
with pyjs (build.sh)
