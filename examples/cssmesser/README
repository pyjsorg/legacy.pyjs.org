This is a port of Google's CSSMess example.

To build, first read the top-level README (run boostrap and buildout)

Then, run ./build.sh or:

    ../../bin/pyjsbuild CSSMess.py

and then open output/CSSMess.html in a web browser.


== Issues ==

Doesn't work with IE, since IE doesn't support children on a style element:
DOM.appendChild(DOM.createElement('style'), <something>) failes
