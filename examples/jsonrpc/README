This example is set up so that the JSONRPC python service is run
by default as a CGI Script.  There is an example python CGI script
server which is set up to allow access to the JSONService.py CGI
script, for this example.  Start it as:

    $ cd examples/jsonrpc/output
    $ python PythonCGIServer.py

If you would like to try this example with Apache2, simply point
the Apache2 server at the examples/ subdirectory and then ensure
that Python scripts are allowed to be executed (see Apache2 manuals
to enable).

If you would like the JSONService.py to be executed under mod_python,
move public/services/htaccess.mod_python to public/services/.htaccess
and rebuild (or copy it to output/) and then restart Apache2.

Thanks to Daniel Carvalho for working out how to run this example
with mod_python.

NOTE: JSONService.py as stand alone didn't work for me. I installed 
apache with php to do the work (on debian squeeze):
  - apt-get install libapache2-mod-php5
  - vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
    add:
        <Directory "<path-to>/pyjamas/examples/">
                Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks +ExecCGI
                AllowOverride None
                Order deny,allow
                Deny from all
                Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128 <possible extra ranges>
                AddHandler cgi-script .py
        </Directory>
  - change the parameter to pyjd.setup (if you do use pyjd) to
    "http://127.0.0.1/examples/jsonrpc/public/JSONRPCExample.html"
