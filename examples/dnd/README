Fails on pyjd-hulahop

Different behavior in 'Using drag feedback images':
FF3.6 - Canvas triangle becomes a browser default image on drop zone
Chrome - All drags become a browser default image until dropped
Opera11 - dragged elements shrink to fit around text on dragging

Using data transfer content types
Chrome - Text / HTML / URI only shows 'URL' content: http://pyjs-dev/examples/dnd/output/pyjamas.png
