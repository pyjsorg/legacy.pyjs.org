 * Didn't have glib bindings (3 weeks intense work)
 * Absolutely great!
   ** CSS, HTML, Javascript, SVG 2D canvas, NPAPI
   ** NPAPI supports Adobe Flash, Java, 'n'everyfing
 * Blindingly quick
 * PyWebkitGtk, PyWebkitQt4, PyWebkitSilk (GChrome)
   ** pygobject rather obtuse (cleanup with wrapper)
   ** PyWebkitQt4 can use gobject (saves dev effort)
 * 650 simultaneous vi instances were harmed during the making...
   ** jobs | grep vi | grep "Window"...
   ** %209
 * webkit-glib isn't just about pywebkitgtk
   ** webkit-glib++ (possibility of Pyjamas++)
   ** webkit-glib-java (possibility of GWT-Desktop)
