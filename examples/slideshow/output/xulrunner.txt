== XULRunner ==
python-xpcom and python-hulahop
 * Works well
 * two main bugs
   ** SVG Canvas drawImage
   ** XMLHttpRequest no user/password parameters
BUT:
 * Mozilla Documentation pretty much useless
 * python-xpcom being excluded from Mozilla codebase
 * Mozilla Foundation Losing Plot (speed, speed, speed)
 * Inexplicable and Total lack of interest in XPCOM
