 * Experiment to run Pyjamas Apps server-side
 * It worked!
   ** DOM.py manipulates XML Document (python-elementree)
   ** XML Document converted to text (output as HTML)
   ** Poorly-formed HTML bit of a lairy nightmare.
 * BUT - oops - browser state information lost.  try saving state...
 * Save XML Document using pickle barfed on python-elementree
   ** pickling not possible with elemtree nodes
   ** fudge it: save XML doc as text, re-load, re-identify nodes
   ** every XML node must be uniquely identified (same problem as python-kde3)
 * Experiment proves it can be done.
   ** Browser clients with no javascript can be supported - just.
   ** Little bit awkward for "standard" mouseover events, resize events etc.
