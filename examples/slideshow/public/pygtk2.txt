== PyGtk2 ==
 * Lacks support for HTML 
 * Lacks support for CSS styling
   ** gtk-css-engine WIP subset of CSS
 * gtkhtml2 lacks "width/height" enforcement
   ** widgets end up with zero height!
 * gtkhtml3 isn't going to exist
   ** Pity - because gtkhtml3 has "HTMLPanel"
== IronPython - gtk# ==
 * Supports HTML (but not properly)

Overall, PyGtk2 not up to the task.
