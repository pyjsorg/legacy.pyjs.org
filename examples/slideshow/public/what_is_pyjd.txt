 * Port of Pyjamas to Desktop
   ** Will run on any desktop platform (and some embedded ones, too!)
   ** Still supports CSS, HTML, NPAPI, SVG - everything thanks to...
 * Uses Browser Engines
   ** Three major runtimes: MSHTML, XulRunner and PyWebkitGtk
   ** MSHTML (not free software) ironically most stable runtime.
   ** pywebkitqt4 needs DOM model manipulation if to be used.
 * Uses port of Pyjamas Library (identical API) to Python
   ** All javascript ripped out, replaced with python
   ** DOM.py most heavily modified
   ** pyjamas.ui.* pretty much left as-is (a few bug-fixes)
   ** pyjslib.py and pyjs.py compiler ripped out.
 * Any comprehensive Python-based DOM manipulator will do, BUT:
   ** Python-KDE3 (KHTMLPart) has subtle bugs (c++ RTTI dependence)
   ** PyXPCOMExt / PyDOM is insanely obtuse - valiantly resisting useability
