 * DOM Modelling is the key to a successful easy widget set
   ** Browser technology tolerant of poor layout, for two decades
   ** Rules regarding "repaint" well established
 * Fully-featured widget set already exists
   ** Text, markup, fonts, SVG (2D), plugins, buttons, blah blah
   ** you just gotta access it!
 * Option A: Webkit
   ** Didn't have a free-software DOM manipulator
   ** (it does now)
 * Option B: Python-KDE3
   ** Grand-daddy of Webkit!
   ** PyKHTML
 * Option C: XulRunner
   ** python-xpcom and python-hulahop
   ** XulRunner 1.9.1 works 99.95%
   ** XulRunner 1.9.2 works 98% (but missing 2% is critical)
   ** Mozilla Foundation Losing The Plot
 * Option D: MSHTML
   ** python-comtypes: well cool.  small dependency (350k)
   ** works perfectly.
 * Option E: GrailBrowser!
   ** Independent of other c-based projects
   ** Insanely slow and insanely old
   ** Who cares!  It's ambitious!
