== pyjs.py ==
 * Well on the way to supporting all of Python 2.N
   ** in 4000 lines of code
 * javascript "undefined" complete pain
   ** not caught at run-time
   ** causes strings n stuff to disappear
   ** Use Pyjamas-Desktop to catch errors
 * sprintf e.g. "test %d" - only accepts 1 argument (bug)
   ** "%s %d" % (arg1, arg2) barfs
 * Don't rely on javascript auto-num-conversion!
   ** "hello" + 5 => "hello5" in Javascript
   ** Stuffs up Pyjamas-Desktop possibilities
 * Javascript quietly happy with too many params!
