 * Porting Pyjamas to Desktop
   ** Use a standard existing Widget set
   ** PyQt4, PyGtk2, IronPython (Gtk#), wxWidgets
   ** Python Web Browser? pybrowser or grailbrowser?
 * What features are required?
   * Must support HTML (somehow)
   * Must have full set of W3C DOM functions
   * Must really support CSS (somehow, or in some form)
   * Must have global and per-widget event-handling
   * Must be able to uniquely identify each widget

Do the existing widget sets cut the mustard?
