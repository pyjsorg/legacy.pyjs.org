This example of the EmployeeAdmin is based on the wxPython version 
by Toby de Havilland <toby.de.havilland@puremvc.org>

For larger applications, it would be advisable to make directories 
with model/controller/view and components.

In order to run this example, You'll need to download PureMVC for Python. 
At the moment of this writing available at:
http://puremvc.org/pages/downloads/Python/PureMVC_Python.zip

To compile the application, the library path must include the puremvc 
files. E.g.:
 ../../bin/pyjsbuild --library_dir "`pwd`/PureMVC_Python_1_2/src" EmployeeAdmin
