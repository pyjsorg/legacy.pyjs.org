All examples in the deprecated are (guess what?) deprecated. This means that
they might work but don't have to. They are also not tested for releases or 
whatsoever. Moreover, they might work for one browser and fail for another.

Updates/fixes are welcome and might change the status from deprecated to
maintained.
