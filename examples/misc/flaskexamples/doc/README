Documentation is not necessarily fun to write, but it is very useful to have.
I have selected to use reStructuredText (sphinx) for my projects as it can be 
converted to many different formats and sphinx can read comments from python
source files.  I have tried (unsuccessfully) to deduce the syntax for the
pyjamas wiki.  What I have done is write a python program to write a sed script
that will substitute links.

Anyhow, the best way to view this is to just install sphinx and run build.sh.
Another method is to just read the index.rst file itself.
