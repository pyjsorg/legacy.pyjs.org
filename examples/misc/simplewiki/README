to get this example working, make sure you have webpy and pymongo installed.  pymongo must be running.

To start the backend, run:

    python server.py


===
NOTE. The example is cripple. It doesn't need pymongo (at least that's
not imported anywhere).

The server.py depends on web.py and listens on port 8080. It can serve the json files, but doesn't serve the (also needed) html and js files.
